          Hi! <br/> <br/> My name's Lewis and I'm a Computer Games Programming graduate with a 2:1 honours degree from the University of Abertay Dundee. Unfortunately
          due to the oversaturated job market I have been unable to source a position relating to my degree therefore have actively changed my
          focus towards Web Development.

        <div>
          I am now actively looking for a web development position. Please take the time to visit my <a href="https://github.com/lshaw212">Github</a> or drop me an email to get in touch <a href="mailto:Lshaw212@gmail.com">Lshaw212@gmail.com</a> :)
