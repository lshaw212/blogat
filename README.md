## Description
Blog@ is a website to create and share blogs with users from all around the world. With the ability to create a blog for any subject with the ability to create, edit and delete posts, while being able to view other blogs and add them to your favourites list. This project was built using React with Node.js and the Express.js framework for the backend. Blog@ uses a RESTful API to fetch data from MongoDB and also utilises Redux to manage application and user state.
